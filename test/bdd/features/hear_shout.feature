Feature: Hear Shout

    Shouty allows users to hear other users as long as they are close enough to each other.


    # Rule: Shouts can be heard by other users

    #     Scenario: Listener hears a message
    #         Given a person named Lucy
    #         And a person named Sean
    #         When Sean shouts "Free bagels at Sean's"
    #         Then Lucy hears Sean's message


    Rule: Shouts should only be heard if listener is within range

        Scenario Outline: Only listener's in range can hear
            Given the range is <Range> meters
            And people are located at:
                | name     | Sean | Lucy |
                | location | 0    | 50   |
            When Sean shouts "Free coffee at Sean's"
            Then Lucy only hears Sean's message when she is in range

            Examples:
                | Range |
                | 102   |
                | 10    |


    # Rule: Listeners can hear multiple shouts

    #     Scenario: Two shouts
    #         Given a person named Lucy
    #         And a person named Sean
    #         When Sean shouts "Free bagels at Sean's"
    #         And Sean shouts "Free coffee at Sean's"
    #         Then Lucy hears the following messages:
    #             | Free bagels at Sean's |
    #             | Free coffee at Sean's |
                

    # Rule: Maximum length of a message

    #     @run-me
    #     Scenario: Message too long
    #         Given a person named Sean
    #         And a person named Lucy
    #         When Sean shouts the following message
    #         """
    #         01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345
